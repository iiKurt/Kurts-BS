Each 'theme' would have three files:
	- Light
	- System
		(both light and dark combined into one CSS file, colors determined by media queries)
		(not available on devices where color-scheme media query isn't supported)
		(will have to fall back to SOMETHING though...)
	- Dark
Or one file:
	- Custom (where the color scheme isn't really light or dark, it's just the natural theme..?)
PLUS:
	- Properties/nothing after the - (where the theme stuff is actually written)
		(don't try to compile this... it won't work)

File naming:
	(theme name)-(type/scheme)
	Example: snowy-custom
	Example: default-light, default-dark, default-system
